<h2>How can I play a song?</h2>
<p>
You can play a song by joining a voice channel and providing a search query (which is required) using  message command <u>play</u>. If you didn't provide any search query then it will give you a guide how to use this that specific play command. It supports <i>youtube, spotify, soundcloud, deezer and more</i>. If you provide a name, then it will search for that query in youtube and you will get song.

<h2>How can I skip the current playing?</h2>
<p>
  You can use <b>skip</b> command in  message command. It just skips the current playing song.
  <br>
  But I can't, it just says "You don't have enough permission to use this command."! Why is it saying like this?
  <br>
  It's because you don't have "Deafen Members" Permission or don't have the dj role to perform this command (if there is a dj setup).
